# EntrisionReports

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/entrision_reports`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'entrision_reports'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install entrision_reports

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

When working with the gem in a project locally (to speed up testing), include the gem in the gemfile normall, then

```bash
bundle config local.entrision_reports /path/to/local/git/repository
```

When you run bundle you should see something like:

```plain
Using entrision_reports 0.1.1 from https://github.com/entrision/entrision_reports.git (at /home/coteyr/Projects/entrision_reports@6ac05ed)
```

To go back to the git version

```bash
bundle config --delete local.entrision_reports
```
